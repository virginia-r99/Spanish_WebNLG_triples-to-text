Here's the result:\n\nAs the album \"Expect_a_Miracle\" by Brian Kelly began to play, the audience was expecting a miracle, as the music was instrumental and had been described as such in the album's title and subsequent singles. This was followed by \"Pools_of_Light\", another album by Brian Kelly, which is also known for its instrumental nature. However, the album \"Expect_a_Miracle\" is the one that came first, and its runtime is 54.56 minutes long. This album was a significant departure from Kelly's previous work, and its genre was eventually established as instrumental music.",

The crisis was sparked by the power struggles between the Holy Roman Emperor and the Swedish king, and it ultimately led to a period of instability and conflict that would shape the course of European history. The crisis had a profound impact on the development of the English language, which would eventually become the language of international communication and diplomacy, and would be spoken by millions of people around the world.",
