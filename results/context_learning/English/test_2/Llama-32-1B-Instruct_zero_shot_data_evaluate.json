According to various studies, the mortality rate on factory farms is significantly higher than that of similar farms, with some estimates suggesting that up to 83.0% of animals may die within the first year of arrival. This is due to a range of factors, including overcrowding, inadequate ventilation, and the use of substandard feed and living conditions. As a result, many experts and animal welfare organizations have called for stricter regulations and better working conditions to be implemented on factory farms to reduce the risk of animal death and improve the overall health and well-being of the animals.",

The Velvet Underground's music was released on the Polydor Records label, and the album was also released on the Universal Music Group label, marking a significant shift in the band's commercial output.",
